Google Code Jam 2016 in C++
===========================

This is my first online algorithmic puzzles contest. And without training!

Here I share my C++ source code for Google Code Jam 2016 (all are correct, made with love).

I live in Paris (France), but I am supporting the Colombian team ;-)

Qualification Round
-------------------

Saturday 9 April 2016, online.

* There are 27170 competitors having submitted at least one correct answer.
* I do not know how many participants have registered to this conext... (who knows?)
* I suppose there are 29356 competitors having attempted to compete   
  (this is the number of competitors for Problem A Small dataset)

I have obtained 65 points over 100, my rank is 5884:

* Top 22% of all competitors having submitted at least one correct answer
* Top 20% of all competitors having competing (having attempted to solve Problem A Small dataset)

Minimal points to be qualified for Online Round 1 is 30 points.  
Therefore I am qualified for Round 1 :-)

| Problem   | Time spent | Users for small dataset | Users for large dataset |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| [A. Counting Sheep][]          | 1.5 hour | 29356 (100%), 90% correct (90%) | 26216 (89%), 98% correct (88%)
| [B. Revenge of the Pancakes][] | 4 hours  | 23686  (81%), 95% correct (77%) | 22147 (75%), 97% correct (73%)

Pourcentage in brackets is the comparaison over the total number of attendees
(supposed to be the number of competitor having attempted to solve Problem A Small dataset).
