OK, I was bad, rank #7175 over 10149 competitors (#47 among 88 Colombian competitors).

I have learnt the qualification is easy, but to succeed Round-1, the most important is to find the tricks to solve the problems in a simple way. Therefore, I have to avoid running into a complex implementation. Keep calm and think about tricks... Easier said than done, let's see if I can progress on Round-1B...
